Hello,
Thank you for reading this.

I chose to use JavaScript as my language because it allows me many avenues of approach to complete any given task.

I chose the Mocha framework because it is efficient and I prefer the 'describe-it' syntax, even though I mix in some Gherkin 'if's, then's, when's' if it will make my output read better.
